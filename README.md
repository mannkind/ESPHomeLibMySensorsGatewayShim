# ESPHomeMySensorsGatewayShim

A barebones shim to enable an ESPHome device to function as a MySensors MQTT Gateway. Tested with ESPHome 1.12.1, MySensors 2.3.0, and a Wemos D1 Mini w/an RF24 Radio.

## Setup/Use

Take a look at the example directory for a fully working example (very close to my setup).
